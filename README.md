Set up a small network of 2 to 4 computers using Switch. It includes installation of LAN Cards, Preparation of Cables, Assigning IP addresses and sharing C drive.

Small Network Setup Project

OBJECTIVE

This project demonstrates setting up a small network of 2 to 4 computers using a switch. It includes:
Installing LAN cards
Preparing Ethernet cables
Assigning IP addresses
Sharing the C drive among connected devices.

FEATURES

Ethernet Cable Preparation: Followed standard color coding (Cat 5e and Cat 6 cables) for reliable data transmission.
IP Configuration: Assigned IP addresses and subnet masks using a DHCP server for automatic addressing.
File Sharing: Configured network sharing for efficient resource access.
Network Modes:
Wired Connection: Established using straight-through cables.
Wireless Connection: Configured routers for multiple networks.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Hardware Preparation:
Install LAN cards on each computer.
Use straight-through cables to connect the devices to the switch.
Ethernet Cable Preparation:
Use the following color coding:
Pair 1 (TX+): White with Blue Stripe
Pair 2 (TX-): Blue with White Stripe
Pair 3 (RX+): White with Green Stripe
Pair 6 (RX-): Green with White Stripe
Network Configuration:
Assign IP addresses manually or enable DHCP for automatic assignment.
Verify connectivity using tools like ping or traceroute.
File Sharing:
Enable "Network Discovery" and "File and Printer Sharing" on all computers.
Share the C drive by setting permissions for users.

PROJECT DETAILS

DHCP Server Usage: Automated IP configuration and subnet masking.
Router Configuration:
Configured multiple wireless routers with unique network names.
Connected end devices to specific networks.
Testing: Verified connectivity using network tools and checked file sharing functionality.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

Hardware: Switch, LAN cards, Ethernet cables, Routers.
Software: Windows Network Configuration Tools, DHCP server.
Protocols: TCP/IP, DHCP, ARP.
